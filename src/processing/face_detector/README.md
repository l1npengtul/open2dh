This code is heavily adapted from [VTuber_Unity](https://github.com/kwea123/VTuber_Unity/tree/master/head_pose_estimation) (which is heavily borrowed from [head-pose-estimation](https://github.com/yinguobing/head-pose-estimation) and partly from [GazeTracking](https://github.com/antoinelame/GazeTracking)), with the DL models also being taken from the original projects. This is a rust translation & adaptation.
